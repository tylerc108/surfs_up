## Analysis Overview
For this weeks module, we conducted analysis on a set of weather data for a surf shop owner in Hawaii. The shop owner wanted our help analyzing the weather data to see if the island of Oahu is a good spot to open a new location. We received a SQLite database from the shop owner and conducted analysis on it by looking at the precipitation and temperature data stored in the database and determining if the climate of this location is ideal for surfing conditions.
