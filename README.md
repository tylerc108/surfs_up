## Analysis Overview
For this weeks module, we conducted analysis on a set of weather data for a surf shop owner in Hawaii. The shop owner wanted our help analyzing the weather data to see if the island of Oahu is a good spot to open a new location. We received a SQLite database from the shop owner and conducted analysis on it by looking at the precipitation and temperature data stored in the database and determining if the climate of this location is ideal for surfing conditions.


## Results 
### What are some key differences we observed in weather data between June and December?
Below is a screenshot of the temperature results from June:

Below is a screenshot of the temperature results from December:

* The mean temperature for June was 3 degrees higher than the one in December. This is not a very big difference in temperature, and in both instances the temperature is high enough to facilitate good surfing conditions, i.e. warm/high temperatures. 
* The standard deviation was slightly higher in December than it was in June. This means that temperatures in June are more consistent than in December. 
* The minimum temperature for December was 56 degrees, while the minimum temperature in June was 64 degrees. 56 degrees is likely a bit too cool to be ideal weather for surfing, but it is still possible to go surfing at this temperature, perhaps with a wetsuit.
* The maximum temperature for December was 83 degrees, while the maximum temperature for June was 85 degrees. These temperatures are very close to each other and both are very ideal for surfing conditions.

## Summary
What we found essentially shows that this location is a very good spot for a surf shop. The temperatures are high enough in both the summer and winter months to go surfing frequently, so there will certainly be a lot of demand for surf supplies in this area. The lowest temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees, which is chilly but still possible to surf in. Even if this is too cold for some to go surfing in, the surf shop could stock wetsuits and likely bring in business selling gear for colder-temperature surfing.
Two things we would like to look more deeply into and analyze would be to see what wind speeds and wave height data looks like in June and December. Knowing wind speeds would benefit us because if it is too windy, waves could become very choppy and difficult to surf. Knowing average wave height data would benefit us because most surfers enjoy surfing waves that are big, but not big enough to be dangerous to surf. If the waves are consistently very small or if they are consistently completely massive this would deter surfers from this location.
